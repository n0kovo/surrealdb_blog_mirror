# Getting started

The JavaScript SDK for SurrealDB lets you connect to a database and query it from your application. This guide covers connecting, authenticating, and running your first queries.

## 1. Install the SDK

Follow the [installation guide](../reference/javascript/installation.md) to install the SDK as a dependency in your project.
Once installed, you can import and instantiate the SDK to start using it.

**ESM**

```ts

// Create a new Surreal instance
const db = new Surreal();
```

**CommonJS**

```ts
const { Surreal } = require('surrealdb');

// Create a new Surreal instance
const db = new Surreal();
```

The `Surreal` class can be instantiated multiple times to connect to multiple SurrealDB instances at once.

## 2. Connect to SurrealDB

You can use the `.connect()` method to connect to a local or remote SurrealDB instance.
This method accepts a connection string and a set of options, including namespace, database, and authentication details. Supported connection protocols include:

- **WebSocket** (`ws://`, `wss://`) for long-lived connections (e.g. backend or frontend applications)
- **HTTP** (`http://`, `https://`) for short-lived stateless connections (e.g. server-side rendering applications)
- **Embedded** engines using the [WebAssembly engine](../reference/javascript/engines/wasm.md) or [Node.js engine](../reference/javascript/engines/node.md)

This approach is suitable for connecting to a SurrealDB instance as a [system user](../learn/security/authentication/authentication.md#system-user), for example when connecting from a server-side application.

```ts
const db = new Surreal();

// Connect as system user using the WebSocket protocol
await db.connect('ws://localhost:8000', {
	namespace: "company_name",
	database: "project_name",
	authentication: {
		username: 'root',
		password: 'root'
	}
});
```

Alternatively you can use the `.signin()` method to authenticate, however passing the authentication details to the `.connect()` method is the preferred way and allows for automatic reconnecting.

## 3. Inserting data into SurrealDB

Once connected, you can use the `.create()` method to execute a [`CREATE`](../reference/query-language/statements/create.md) query. This method accepts either a `Table` or a `RecordId` as the first argument. Use the `.content()` chain to specify the record data.

```ts

const users = new Table('users');
const products = new Table('products');

// Create a record with a random id
const user = await db.create(users).content({
	name: 'John',
	email: 'john@example.com',
	age: 32
});

console.log(user);
// { id: user:w6xb3izpgvz4n0gow6q7, name: 'John', email: 'john@example.com', age: 32 }

// Create a record with a specific ID
const appleId = new RecordId(products, 'apple');
const product = await db.create(appleId).content({
	name: 'Apple',
	price: 1.50,
	category: 'fruit'
});

console.log(product);
// { id: product:apple, name: 'Apple', price: 1.50, category: 'fruit' }
```

## 4. Retrieving data from SurrealDB

### Selecting records

The `.select()` method retrieves all records from a table, or a single record by its `RecordId`.
You can chain methods like `.fields()`, `.where()`, and `.limit()` to refine your query.

```ts

const users = new Table('users');
const products = new Table('products');

// Select all users
const allUsers = await db.select(users);

// Select a specific record by ID
const apple = await db.select(new RecordId(products, 'apple'));

// Select specific fields with filtering
const results = await db.select(products)
	.fields('name', 'price')
	.where(eq("category", "fruit"))
	.limit(10);
```

In addition to the `.eq()` function in the above example, we offer a comprehensive set of [expression utilities](../reference/javascript/api/utilities/expr.md) for building type-safe SurrealQL conditions.

### Running SurrealQL queries

For more advanced use cases, you can use the `.query()` method to run [SurrealQL](../reference/query-language/index.md) statements directly. Use [parameters](../reference/query-language/language-primitives/parameters.md) to safely pass dynamic values.

```ts
const [cheapProducts] = await db.query<[{ name: string; price: number }[]]>(
	'SELECT name, price FROM product WHERE price < $max_price ORDER BY price',
	{ max_price: 5.00 }
);

console.log(cheapProducts);
// [{ name: 'Apple', price: 1.50 }]
```

## 5. Closing the connection

Once you are done, close the connection to free up resources.

```ts
await db.close();
```

## Next steps
