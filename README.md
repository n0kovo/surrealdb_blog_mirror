- **2026-06-05** · [Context layers, semantic layers, and knowledge graphs: the modern data architecture for AI](posts/2026/06/context-layers-semantic-layers-and-knowledge-graphs-the-modern-data-architecture-for-ai.md)  
  `company` — Three concepts AI teams constantly confuse: a context layer assembles the right data into an LLM prompt at query time, a semantic layer maps raw data to business meaning, and a knowledge graph stores entities and their relationships. Most teams build all three by stitching together separate graph, vector, and relational systems - creating sync problems, higher latency, and rising costs. SurrealDB's multi-model architecture handles all three natively, letting a single SurrealQL query run vector search, graph traversal, and document retrieval in one round trip

- **2026-05-19** · [Agentic retrieval for structured data with text-to-surql](posts/2026/05/agentic-retrieval-for-structured-data-with-text-to-surql.md)  
  `ai` `tutorials` — RAG pipelines usually focus on unstructured content (chunks + vectors\/BM25), but structured data introduces a different retrieval problem: you need to pull exact rows and aggregates from tables, not just “similar passages.” This article explains an agentic pattern for structured retrieval using text-to-SurrealQL: give an LLM agent a single database-aware tool that converts natural-language questions into valid SurrealQL, executes the query in SurrealDB, and returns deterministic, auditable results.
